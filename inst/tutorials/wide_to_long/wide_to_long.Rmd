# Converting Data from Wide To Long



## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll be discussing the difference between wide data and long data. We'll also see how we can transition from wide to long using both the `tidyr` package as well as base R.

First, lets take a look at each format and how they differ.

## The Long Data Format

In the long format, the unit of analysis (for example, height and weight) are separated into separate variables and are therefore given their own column.

Each row represents a single time point per subject, so multiple responses for the same subject will be given their own row.

Because of this, data in the long format will generally have more rows than its wide format counterpart

Generally, most of the datasets you work with in R will be in the long format.

## The Wide Data Format

In the wide format, a subjects repeated responses will be in a single row. This will "group" all of the categorical data according to the subject.

Because of this, data in the wide format will generally have less rows than its long format counterpart

## Converting between formats

There may be certain situations where you are given a dataset, but need to convert it into a different format. This can be done using the `tidyr` package in R (which is part of the `tidyverse` collection), or by using the `reshape()` function in base R. 

This tutorial will detail how to transition wide data to long data, but you can also use these tools to transition from long data to wide.

We will make the following wide dataset named `wide` (which is shown below)

```{r}
wide
```

Into the long format where a column is used to keep track of the time period

```{r}
long
```


## Tidyverse Approach using tidyr

To use this approach, make sure you have the `tidyr` package installed (which comes bundled in with `tidyverse`).

The two functions we can use are going to be `pivot_longer()` and its inverse `pivot_wider()`.

To achieve our desired dataframe, we are going to need to use both functions. Here is the documentation for both: 

pivot_longer: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html

pivot_wider: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html



To complete this problem, we are going to need to specify a few arguments.

For `pivot_longer()`:

`cols` refer toi the specific columns we want to pivot. This should be all the columns that are not an ID

`names_to` specifies what to name the new column that will be created. For example, column "v1/mean" refers to two attributes, a time and a statistic.

`names_sep` details how the column names should be broken up. Is there a character we can use to separate the names? (Hint: What character separates the time and statistic?)

For `pivot_wider()`:

`names_from` describes which column to get the names from. This column will be from the resulting dataframe after you use `pivot_wider()`.

`values_from` denotes the actual cell values. In this case, the values would be the actual numbers.

See if you can fill in the blanks yourself (make sure you install tidyr):


```{r tidyverse, exercise = TRUE}
library(tidyr)
wide %>% tidyr::pivot_longer(cols= , names_to = c(), names_sep=) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = , values_from = ) -> new_long 
```


```{r tidyverse-solution}
library(tidyr)
wide %>% tidyr::pivot_longer( `v1/mean`:`v4/median`, names_to = c("time","stat"), names_sep="/") %>% # pivot longer to separate vs from stat
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = stat, values_from = value) -> new_long # Recreate stats using pivot wider
new_long
```


## Base R Approach using `reshape`

A non tidyverse approach to solve the same problem can be done using the `reshape()` function that comes built in with R.

Here is the documentation for it: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/reshape

You'll need to fill in the following arguments to get the desired result:


`idvar` is the name of the column that is used to identify each of the subjects. In this case, we can use the subject IDs.

`sep` is a character that can be used to distinguish between two variable names in the wide format. It should be the same as `names_sep` from the tidyr example.

`v.names` asks for a vector containing the names of the new columns you want to create. In our case, we need a column for each of the three statistics.

`timevar` is the name of the column that will hold the categorical attribute of our subject. We can leave it as "time" for now.

`times` refers to the possible values the categorical obsvervation can take. In our case, we have four possible time values, so we'll need to pass in a vector with their names.\

`varying` requires a list of names of sets of variables in the wide format that correspond to single variables in long format. We can gather these names by searching for them using the "grep" function. You just need to
fill in what names we are looking for.

See if you can fill in the missing arguments:

```{r base_r, exercise = TRUE}
# Covert our table to a dataframe using as.data.frame so that it works with reshape
in_data <- as.data.frame(wide) 

to_long <- reshape(data = in_data, direction = "long", idvar = "", sep ="", v.names = , 
                   timevar = "time", times =,
                   varying = list(grep(, colnames(in_data), value=T), grep(, colnames(in_data), value=T), grep(, colnames(in_data), value=T)))

to_long # Print the result
```


```{r base_r-solution}
# Covert using as.data.frame
in_data <- as.data.frame(wide) 
# Use reshape to covert from wide to long
to_long <- reshape(data = in_data, direction = "long", idvar = "ID1", sep ="/", v.names = c("mean", "sd", "median"), timevar = "time", times =c("v1", "v2", "v3", "v4"),
        varying = list(grep("mean", colnames(in_data), value=T), grep("sd", colnames(in_data), value=T), grep("median", colnames(in_data), value=T)))

to_long
```
